# CC Personal Box
This is an open source cross-platform application structure.

**User Story**
Many applications are necessary in my daily life, for example, expense tracking and exercise, and need basic features are required, but not the applications with complex features, tracking service.

This is what CC Personal Box for, building a personal, private cross-platform and easy-to-use applications without data leaking, with basic features which are just enough.

It may not offer high UX like what Applce can give,
It may not offer 24/7 service like many companies offer,

But it offer you freedom.
